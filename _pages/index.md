__Our goal at AppLand is to help code “speak for itself.__
We’re a group of passionate engineers and architects aiming to drive innovation in software architecture and design. Software is oftentimes complex and its nuances can be difficult to communicate efficiently. We'd like to change that.

## Open Source Initiatives

### AppMap framework

The AppMap framework provides a means of gathering detailed information of your application’s inner workings. Use this information to generate insightful visualizations and analytics to share with your team.

### AppMap data specification

The AppMap data specification aims to capture detailed information of runtime code execution, data snapshots and application metadata. This specification is being developed by AppLand and its contributors to create a standard around data used in analyzing and visualizing application architecture, behavior and design. The working specification is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap).

### Recording client

The recording client enables an application to dynamically record and emit app map files. Use the app map files you’ve captured to generate insightful visualizations and analytics of the behavior and architecture of your code. Clients are currently available for [Java](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-java) or [Ruby](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-ruby).
