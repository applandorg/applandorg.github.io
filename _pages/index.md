Getting people oriented around software architecture and design is necessary and required for them to make high-quality improvements. And the learning curve is simply too steep for many developers in increasingly large codebases. 

AppMaps allow for a culture where developers and leaders can self-service and self-educate on questions of architecture and design. A culture where architectural analysis and refinement is possible on a continuous basis, and where hard to identify and complex bugs are made evident and avoidable before they hit production.

### AppMap framework

The AppMap framework provides a means of gathering detailed information of your application’s inner workings. Use this information to generate insightful visualizations and analytics to share with your team.

### AppMap data specification

The AppMap data specification aims to capture detailed information of runtime code execution, data snapshots and application metadata. This specification is being developed by AppLand and its contributors to create a standard around data used in analyzing and visualizing application architecture, behavior and design. The working specification is available [here on GitHub](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap).

### Recording client

The recording client enables an application to dynamically record and emit app map files. Use the app map files you’ve captured to generate insightful visualizations and analytics of the behavior and architecture of your code. Clients are currently available for [Java](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-java) or [Ruby](https://github.com/applandinc/appmap-ruby).

__Our goal at AppLand is to help code “speak for itself.__
We’re a group of passionate engineers and architects aiming to drive innovation in software architecture and design. Software is oftentimes complex and its nuances can be difficult to communicate efficiently. We'd like to change that.
