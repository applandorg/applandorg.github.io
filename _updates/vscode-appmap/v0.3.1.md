# Misc bug fixes
- The component diagram view has been renamed to `dependency map`.
- The flow view has been renamed to `trace`.
- `Reset view` can be selected from the context menu from anywhere in the
viewport.
- Packages are now visible when expanded.
- The details panel will now scroll vertically. This prevents issues when
centering the dependency map.
- HTTP server responses are now visible in the event details panel.
