This update provides a number of fixes and enhancements to items raised by the
community over the last week. Our current focus is on improving overall user
experience, ease of navigability and installation process. Here are some of the
highlights from this week:

# Dependency map
When selecting a package that is expanded, all child objects will now appear
highlighted. In addition, you can now click an expanded package to select that
object.

HTTP server request routes will now display normalized paths if that information
is available. Make sure you're using a recent version of the appmap recording
client to capture normalized paths.

# Misc bug fixes
### Dependency map
- The `View source` option in the context menu (right click)
will now appropriately open source code.
- Components which have no associated runtime execution data will no longer be
displayed.
- Packages will continue to be highlighted after expand, collapse or switching
views.
- Package names now display their nested children instead of solely the top
level package identifier when viewing an `appmap.json` generated from Java.

### Trace
- HTTP events in the trace view will now be named correctly when viewing an
`appmap.json` generated from Java.

### Details panel
- Links from a class to a query now link to the expected destination.
- Details for query events no longer display the raw SQL in the title.
